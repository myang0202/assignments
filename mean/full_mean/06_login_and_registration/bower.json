  "description": "Create a login and registration that uses back-end validation, catches errors and returns them to an Angular factory. Have a login controller that can differentiate between a proper login and errors. If there are errors show the errors using angular (ng-show/ng-if/ng-hide might help), otherwise set the newly logged-in user or registered user to a variable in the factory that is retrieved by the controller.",
