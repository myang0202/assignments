//Create a struct called "Card"
//
//Give the Card struct a property "value" which will hold the value of the card (A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K). This value should be a String
//Give the Card a property "Suit" which will hold the suit of the card (Clubs, Spades, Hearts, Clubs)
//Give the Card a property "numerical_value" which will hold the numerical value of the card 1-13

struct Card {

//Next, create a class called "Deck"
//
//Give the Deck class a property called "cards" of type [Card]
//When initializing the deck make sure that it has the 52 unique cards in its "cards" property
//Give the Deck a deal method that selects the "top-most" card, removes it, and returns it
//Give the Deck a reset method that resets the cards property to the contain the original 52 cards
//Give the Deck a shuffle method that randomly reorders the deck's cards

//Finally, create a class called "Player"
//
//Give the Player class a name property
//Give the Player a hand property of type [Card]
//Give the Player a draw method of type (Deck) -> Card which draws a card from a deck, adds it to the players hand, and returns it
//Note how we are passing the Deck by reference here since it is a class.
//Give the Player a discard method of type (Card) -> Bool which discards the Card specified and returns True if the Card existed and was successfully removed or False if the Card was not in the player's hand.
